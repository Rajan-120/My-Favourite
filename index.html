            I love to go to new places. Every Sunday, I go to some natural places with my father. Whenever I get time I go out, walk a mile, take pics, and just enjoy the beauty of nature. We also make tea on chulah in rocky places. I also like gardening. I planted many trees in our garden during the lockdown period.
